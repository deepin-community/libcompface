libcompface (1989.11.11-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Man pages now included in altdev package too.
  * Provided links in /usr/doc for all the package names
  * Moved the /usr/doc stuff from the dev package to the so lib packages. Fixes Bug #15147.
  * Copyright file updated to relect the fact that the original package is splited into several debian packages
  * The libs are now stripped. Fixes Bug #15670.
  * Changed headder into header in the descriptions.
  * libcompface1 now depends on libc5 (>= 5.4.0.0). Fixes bug #14790.
  * Darren <torin@daft.com> fixed this (Bug #14632):
      1. The Makefile invocation uses LDFLAGS which isn't in the Makefile and
         the link doesn't use implicit rules, so it doesn't get used.
      2. '-D_REENTRANT' needs to be passed in CFLAGS for the shared objects.
      3. '-lc' needs to be passed to the link stage of the shared library so
         that ldso knows what libc it goes to.
      4. The sequential commands linked by ';' should instead be linked by
         '&&'.  This ensures that if a command fails, that rule fails.
      5. make install is invoked in the debian/rules binary-arch target when
         the install stuff has been done already and the install isn't correct
         for the current Makefile.
    I where unable to get your patch accepted so I had to apply it by hand. I 
    hope I got it all right...
